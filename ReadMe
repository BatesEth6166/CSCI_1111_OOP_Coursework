# Asteroid Adventure

## Synopsis
This is a game using JavaFX where the player ship evades pirates, using missiles and boosters to collect treasures and get to the exit.

## Motivation
I made this to build upon my last project, to improve it and make it more useable and look better.

## How to Run
you can run the program using coderunner, simply pull up the files and select run. If your IDE is equipped with javaFX that will also be able to run it

## Code Example
I am rather proud of this code snippit, which makes a transition animation for the scenes, helps it look cooler. I looked up how to do this but implementing it was a whole other nightmare.
TranslateTransition slideIn = new TranslateTransition(Duration.seconds(2), gridPane);
        gridPane.setTranslateY(-scene.getHeight());
        slideIn.setToY(0);
